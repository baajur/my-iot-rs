# Introduction

**Disclaimer**: the documentation is not complete at the moment and even though I strive to update it, I don't have enough time right now to keep it perfect.

## What Is It?

I'm writing something similar to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) from ground up for my tiny set of "smart" devices.

And no, I didn't think about the project name long enough.

### Why?

- I want to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- I want it to be as less configurable as possible
- I want it to run fast on my [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)

### Stack

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)
- [Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Rhai](https://schungx.github.io/rhai/about/index.html)
